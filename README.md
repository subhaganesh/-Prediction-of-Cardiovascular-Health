# Deployiny Heart_disease_prediction app in streamlit using hugging spaces
This Streamlit app serves as a simple tool for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on input features. The user can input key factors such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and more. The app provides an intuitive interface with sliders and dropdowns for data input.

Behind the scenes, the app employs a basic prediction model to calculate a prediction based on the input values. While the current model is simplistic, the framework allows seamless integration with more advanced machine learning models for accurate predictions.

The app demonstrates how Streamlit can be harnessed to create interactive and user-friendly interfaces for predictive modeling. Its ease of use makes it a valuable tool for both developers and non-technical users to quickly explore and understand potential health risks.
